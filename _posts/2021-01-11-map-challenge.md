This year, I took part in the [30 day map challenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge). I didn't manage to complete every single day, but I did my best, and I loved thinking about the datasets and picking the color palettes. Below are the maps I've made, with descriptions and links to data sources where relevant. The code and all maps can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/ivabrunec/30daymapchallenge/tree/main/2021). <br>

It's been an interesting experience thinking about how information is visualized in maps. As scientists, we spend a lot of time thinking about the clearest way to convey our findings, but we often have a particular pattern in mind that we want to emphasize and to distill years of work into a single figure. In contrast, I found myself wanting to mentally 'zoom out' a lot when making these maps. Emphasizing any one aspect too much felt like losing track of the territory - but including all of the available information felt like I was no longer looking at a map of anything at all. As with many parts of life, this mapping adventure was an exercise in calibrated redundancy. Sometimes I succeeded, sometimes I failed, mostly I hoped for the best while waiting for my laptop to render.

This challenge has also made me think a lot about how we absorb information from maps. It's a little funny (in a sad way) that I research spatial navigation and have only learned recently that humans [vary dramatically](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00524.x) in how well we read maps. It's not surprising, of course, given everything else we know about variability in [navigation skills](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417744521). Some of the best navigators among us (London taxi drivers) learn by [reading maps](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.04.447168v1.abstract), intensively, and then relating the 2D representation to the territory. It's no wonder that it's a multi-year undertaking - but the directionality of the causal arrow is an interesting question. Is it that some people extract spatial structure just by glancing at a map and this skill can be honed, or is it that anyone could develop elaborate map-reading abilities if they put in years of practice?
Either way, it seems important to understand human memory and behavior if we want to help people find their way in the world.
