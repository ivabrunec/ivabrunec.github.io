## 30 day chart challenge 2024  

This was the first time I completed all 30 maps within 30 days.

The highlights included learning how to clip raster images to match to georeferenced vintage map extents, exploring Mapbox capabilities with `rdeck` and `mapgl` and drawing on Toronto city data to build maps of cyclist accidents over time.
